    <strong><a href="https://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a></strong><br>
    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply <i>dummy text</i> of the <small>printing</small> and <em>typesetting</em> industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <ins>It was popularised</ins> in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <del>including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</del>
